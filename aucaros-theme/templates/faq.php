                                <div class="accordion-content">
                                    <p>Collagen is the most abundant protein in the human body needed for the structure and density of the skin. Approximately 80% of young and healthy skin is made up of collagen, however, with time and natural ageing the body’s ability to replenish collagen decreases by about 1.5% per year.</p>

                                <div class="accordion-content">
                                    <p>The collagen naturally present in our skin, joints, tendons and ligaments has a high molecular weight (~300kDa). If applied on skin topically, it cannot be absorbed and if ingested, it is not easily digested or absorbed. The collagen used in our product is hydrolysed collagen (a smaller peptide form of collagen), which has a lower molecular weight (0.3 – 8KDa).&nbsp; It is easily digested in the stomach and absorbed in the small intestine where it enters the blood stream and reaches the deeper layer of the skin.</p>

                                <div class="accordion-content">
                                    <p>PRO.COLLAGENIUM stimulates the cells responsible for the body’s own natural production of collagen, elastin and moisture-retaining hyaluronic acid.&nbsp; It is able to work in the deeper layer of the skin (dermis) and all over the body, whereas creams act on the outer layer of the skin (epidermis) only.</p>

                                <div class="accordion-content">
                                    <p>Most of the collagen products available on the market contain 1 g, 3 g or 5 g of collagen per dosage. These dosages have no clinically proven positive effect on your skin as the only dosage that has shown clinically proven effect on the skin is 10 g per day.</p>

                                <div class="accordion-content">
                                    <p>Auracos uses hydrolysed collagen extracted from fish skin; no other animal sources of collagen are used. All fish used to extract the collagen come from fish farms registered by the European Union for the import of edible fish and are deemed fit for human consumption and guaranteed by health certificates signed by official authorities.&nbsp;</p>

                                <div class="accordion-content">
                                    <p>Aside from being easier to swallow, a liquid is more readily absorbed as soon as it enters the stomach. Daily dosage (25ml) of PRO.COLLAGENIUM contains up to 10,000 mg of hydrolysed collagen which can be up to 40 times more than a typical collagen tablet. Tablets and capsules may cost less, but in reality, liquid represents far better value as more hydrolysed collagen can be absorbed and distributed to the body.</p>

                                    <p>The product results will vary depending on the individual and their starting skin, hair, health conditions, diet and lifestyle. According to our clinical trial results, with daily and consecutive use of the product (1 x 25 ml bottle), one can expect the skin to become more hydrated within 3 weeks, followed by a reduction in fine lines and deeper wrinkles within 6 weeks and an increase in skin elasticity within 9 weeks. Some individuals have reported to experience more positive results and/or at a faster rate than others.&nbsp; Our recommendation is that the product should be taken for 3 months in order to realize all its benefits. Thereafter, it is a personal decision to continue, take a break or stop the treatment depending upon one’s own lifestyle.</p>
